## RHEPY (*Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator in Python*)

This is basically the same as [RHETIC](https://github.com/sirkhancision/RHETIC), which is written in C. This version is probably easier to understand, and has better overall compatibility with different systems. It also has text soft-wrapping in a sane way, so that's a plus!

Just run `./main.py` to execute the program

- Dependencies:
	+ ansiwrap
	+ colorama
